# Internet
The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.  

### DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.  

### Domain Name
A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as ‘google.com’, and ‘facebook.com’. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the DNS system.  

### Hosting
Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website.
