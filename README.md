# Internet
The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.  

### DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.  

### Domain Name
A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as ‘google.com’, and ‘facebook.com’. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the DNS system.  

### Hosting
Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website.

## Version Control Systems
Version control/source control systems allow developers to track and control changes to code over time. These services often include the ability to make atomic revisions to code, branch/fork off of specific points, and to compare versions of code. They are useful in determining the who, what, when, and why code changes were made.  
### Git
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.  
## Repo Hosting Services
When working on a team, you often need a remote place to put your code so others can access it, create their own branches, and create or review pull requests. These services often include issue tracking, code review, and continuous integration features. A few popular choices are GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and AWS CodeCommit.  
### GitHub
GitHub is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.  
***Other Options:***
* GitLab, Bitbucket

## OS & General Knowledge
Operating System is a program that manages a computer’s resources, especially the allocation of those resources among other programs. Typical resources include the central processing unit (CPU), computer memory, file storage, input/output (I/O) devices, and network connections.  

## Relational Databases
A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases store data in a series of tables. Interconnections between the tables are specified as foreign keys. A foreign key is a unique reference from one row in a relational table to another row in a table, which can be the same table but is most commonly a different table.
